Main difference is scoping rules. 
Variables declared by var keyword are scoped to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) 
while let variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by { }.


Example:

var f = "Sai"; 
{
  
  let f = "Kiran";
  console.log(f);  // output will be Kiran
}

  console.log(f); //output will be Sai

  
}

const scope is defined as 'block scoped' (the scope of which, is restricted to the block in which it is declared).
Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects.

In const keyword while initialization value must be provided otherwise it will results in an error.


Example:
 const reg; //Error

  const reg="Hyderabad"; // valid const variable
  console.log(reg); // Hyderabad

For constant variable new value cannot be assigned after it is already assigned with a value.

  const reg = "Andhrapradesh"; // Error 

You can change the properties of a constant object:

Example
// You can create a const object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// You can change a property:
car.color = "red";

// You can add a property:
car.owner = "Johnson";
